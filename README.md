## SVM4Sketch
Using (SIFT)+SVM For Sketch Database Recognition

The project is codes with Google Colab (with K80 GPU/CPU) in a nutshell.

Sketch recognition based on paper [How Do Humans Sketch Objects? (Eitz et al. 2012)](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/).

## Credits and Thanks
The implementation of the SVM is based on the [HPrinz .sketch-recognition.(Linux Build Sketch Svm + CNN).2018](https://github.com/HPrinz/sketch-recognition)

The SVM approach is described in [How Do Humans Sketch Objects? (Eitz et al. 2012)](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/)
